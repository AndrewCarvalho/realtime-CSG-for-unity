TEST Infinite brushes
TEST adding brush to model -> is brush still part of model brush list?
TEST toggle infinite brush -> part of touching brushes of other brushes?
TEST toggle infinite brush -> is touching brushes empty?
TEST 2d polygon triangulations
TEST changing operationType updates accordingly
TEST creating trigger
TEST vertexChannelFlags!

TEST passthrough -> enabling/disabling it should correctly rebuild hierarchy
TEST duplication + move -> doesn't remove geometry
TEST large move -> removes geometry at old location
TEST BrushMeshInstance.IsValid/UserID/CSGManager.BrushMeshCount/CSGManager.AllBrushMeshInstances

TEST SetBrushFlags / SetBrushOperation -> both touch the same enum internally, so need to make sure they don't accidentally throw away bits

TEST loading an old scene -> check if brushes, operations and models still load

model -> csg-tree + 'view' into tree? (list of brushes to create mesh(es) from)


fix FitSurface
fix naming
clean up API
	have good error messages

Q: cache meshtype in model, instead of storing it in model? (no need to 'retrieve' for model)
	-> could cache 'meshtype' in brush
		-> maybe auto link them somehow for easy finding
	-> ClearCache()
